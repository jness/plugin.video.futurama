    <summary>Futurama is an American animated science fiction sitcom</summary>
    <description>Futurama is an American animated science fiction sitcom created by Matt 
    Groening and developed by Groening and David X. Cohen for the Fox Broadcasting Company. 
    The series follows the adventures of a late 20th-century New York City pizza delivery boy, 
    Philip J. Fry, who, after being unwittingly cryogenically frozen for a thousand years, 
    finds employment at Planet Express, an interplanetary delivery company in the retro-futuristic 31st century. 
    The series was envisioned by Groening in the 1990s while working on The Simpsons, later bringing Cohen 
    aboard to develop storylines and characters to pitch the show to Fox.</description>
